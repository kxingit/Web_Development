<sub>
GitHub & BitBucket HTML Preview allows you to render those files without cloning or downloading whole repositories. It is a client-side solution and does not involve any third party hosting servers (except for Yahoo! Query Language to fetch assets).

<sub>
If you try to open raw versions of any HTML, CSS or JS files in a web browser directly from GitHub, all you will see are sources. GitHub forces them to use the "text/plain" content-type, so they cannot be interpreted. This script overrides it by using Yahoo! Query Language.

<sub>
In order to use it, just prepend this fragment to the URL of any HTML file: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?
